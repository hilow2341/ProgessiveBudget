# Budget-Tracker

Using Progressive Web Application (PWA) this application enables the user to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without an online connection. When entering transactions offline, data should populate the total when connected back online.

### User Story
AS AN avid traveller
I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling

### Business Context
Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to our applications success.
